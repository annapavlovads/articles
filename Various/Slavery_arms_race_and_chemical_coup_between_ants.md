<p>Humans aren’t the only species that have had to deal with the issue of
<i>slavery</i>. Some species of ants also abduct the young of others,
forcing them into laboring for their new masters.
Slave-maker ants such as Protomognathus americanus are known to demonstrate
unusual colony behavior called social parasitism.
Social parasitism is a wide-spread phenomenon in social insects where
one species (the parasite) utilizes the brood care behavior of another species
(the host) or uses its socially managed resources
(e.g., food, shelter) [1].</p>

<p><i>Protomognathus americanus</i> ants are 2-3&nbsp;mm in size
and live in the deciduous forests of the northeastern USA and
adjacent Canadian regions.
Due to their small size a whole colony can inhabit one hollow acorn.
The queen produces offspring but they do not perform the everyday
worker tasks of foraging or caring for broods. Instead, nominated
scout workers identify nearby host ant colonies suitable for attack.
During the attack slave-maker ants steal host pupae and take them back
to their own colony. The pupae are imprinted on the odor of the
slave-maker colony and grow up to perform all of the ordinary worker tasks.
This exploitation of another species' workforce is called
<i>social parasitism</i> [2].</p>

<p>A common question is why slaves don't run away,
perhaps back to their own nest.
The answer is that these ants are not enslaved in the human sense.
Indeed, it's more like adopting a baby. Because they are snatched as pupae
and reared in a slave-making colony, enslaved workers become imprinted
with the odors of the host ants.
In a subterranean world where vision is virtually useless,
a family – even one composed of different species – is defined by
an arsenal of chemicals secreted by the ants and applied to all nest mates.
In ants, the family that <i>sprays together stays together</i> [3]!</p>

<p>However rebellions of the ant slaves do occur,
causing tremendous loses to the slave-making ants.
Sometimes two-thirds of pupae died before they hatched [4].
The mortality rate is even higher (83&nbsp;%) for pupae containing queens,
but very low (3&nbsp;%) for those containing males.
Captives are deliberately killing the healthy pupae.
In about 30&nbsp;% of cases, as in the photo,
the workers would gang up to literally pull the developing ants apart.
Another 53&nbsp;% of the pupae were killed by neglect.
Workers moved them out of the nest chamber.
Rebellion of the captive ants is a vivid example of the
<i>evolutionary arms race</i> between parasite and host.
Because killing the social parasite should decrease threat to the sisters
of enslaved ants from neighbor colonies.</p>

<p>There are several possible scenarios of
how slave-making strategy could evolve.
One possible scenario took place many years ago when ant colony destroyed
competitor's nest in the neighborhood. But instead of
eating trophy eggs and larvae they raised them into additional workers
and gain an advantage in the evolutionary struggle.</p>

<p>Another scenario is imprinted in bizarre way in which
<i>Polyergus ant</i> queens establish new colonies.
Within seconds the slave-making queen bolts for the "legal" queen,
literally pushing aside any workers that attempted to grab her.
It seizes and kills the host queen.
Immediately after the death of the old queen,
the ant nest undergoes a most remarkable transformation.
Workers approach the slave-making queen, and start grooming her.
The Polyergus queen, in turn, assembles any scattered pupae into a neat pile,
and "triumphantly" stands on top of it.
At this point, colony takeover is complete [3].
The queen is dead, long live the queen!</p>

<p>Some workers driven by chemical odors are induced
to kill their own queen themselves. In all cases hosts spend time and energy
raising offspring that has <i>no genetic value to them</i>.
Such exploitation involves intricate parasitic adaptations for deceiving hosts.
It should also provoke host defenses.
Social parasites and their hosts therefore provide excellent opportunities
for the study of evolutionary arms races.</p>

<p>Everlasting arms races result into
complicated context dependent relationships between parasite and host.
One of such relationships was investigated in the work of German scientists [1]
who first studied induced antisocial parasite defense in social insects.
Their experiments resemble earlier studies on stuffed dummy cuckoos
(an artificial stimulus) to simulate a parasite threat to other birds.</p>

<p>They invented that defense strategies include not only aggression
towards slave-makers but to the ants of the same species too.
Why it is so? Let take a look on the
<a href="http://youtu.be/p2cGHlueZzU" target="_blank">slave raid</a>.</p>

<p>The slave raids can be divided in two stages:
the <a href="http://youtu.be/5zOIriWKMZ8" target="_blank">scouting phase</a>
and the <a href="http://youtu.be/YdzEpd657RU" target="_blank">raiding event</a>.
On the first stage a scout discovers and inspects an ant colony [5].
After inspection it returns to the home nest to recruit slave-making workers
and enslaved workers to participate at the following raid [6,&nbsp;7].
Remarkable that raiding party includes workers of <i>both ant species</i>:
slave-makers and their slaves.
Also slaves that participate in raids often harm colony more than slave-makers.
Enslaved ants frequently attack and sting defenders.
In contrast, slave-makers only try to drive away defenders
and use chemical secretions to cause confusion among defenders but never sting.
Chemical secretions cause confusion because slave-makers mimic the odor of prey.
Ants are known to use friend-or-foe identification
based on specific chemical compounds.</p>

<p>Scouting events always precede slave raids,
so the presence of a slave-maker within or close to the ant colony
provides a reliable indicator of an attack in the near future.
If ants detect and kill scout, a raiding attack could be averted.
If scout manages to escape, colony should use the time to prepare for an attack.
As raiding parties consist of both slave-makers and slaves,
colony should not only become more aggressive toward slave-makers
but also to ants of their own species.</p>

<p>Scientists investigated whether the encounter with a slave-maker
induces behavioral changes in free-living host colonies.
They collected colonies of non-parasitic ants and simulated encounters
using dead ants of parasitic and non-parasitic species.
Usage of dead ants eliminates behavioral variations and focuses
on the ant's response to the chemical parasite stimulus.
However, researchers suppose that aggressive reaction on living parasites
could be stronger.</p>

<p>In each experiment they placed a dead ant one centimeter away
from the colony center. Then they record all direct contacts with dead ant
during five minutes. Contacts were scored as non-aggressive and aggressive.
Non-aggressive contacts are those where ants contact with antennas.
Aggressive contacts are: mandible spreading, biting, holding, dragging,
and stinging. All behavioral reactions were easily distinguished.
Then researchers analyzed the ratio between aggressive and all interactions
because this ratio is independent for colony size and activity.</p>

<p>Experiments showed a higher initial aggression level toward slave-makers
than conspecific and different species. However initial scouting event
or in other words presence of a slave-maker ant within a colony triggers
a long-lasting and strong aggressive reaction of colonies towards
both slave-makers and stranger conspecifics. After scout visit
the aggression toward stranger conspecifics was the same as towards
slave-makers themselves.</p>

<p>After five minutes representation of a dead slave-maker
aggression level of the colony increased and elevated over three days.
The response disappeared after two weeks, possibly because benefits
of increased aggression counterbalance potential costs associated with it
(foraging efficiency, lifespan, etc.).</p>

<p>Stable aggression towards slave-maker is intuitively clear.
Killing parasite increases chances for survival.
But the response toward stranger conspecifics is context dependent.
It depends on a previous encounter with parasite
(more aggressive after such an encounter).
Indeed, contact to a single slave-making ant in the nest is a reliable cue
that a slave raid is forthcoming and aggressive response toward conspecifics
results in higher survival probability of the attacked colony.
Especially if take into account that
conspecifics killing more ants during slave raid.</p>

<p>There is an open question about the cost of aggressive behavior.
Why it lasts only for two weeks? How to measure cost of aggression?
Sometimes it is hard to find right parameters in this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_(game)#Hawk–dove" target="_blank">
Hawk-Dove game</a>.</p>

<p>There are many other amazing facts illustrating arms races.
For example, aggression between conspecific colonies competing
for the same resources is variable and environment dependent.
Colonies from high-density areas are more aggressive toward competitors
than colonies from low-density areas. Moreover, colonies react
more aggressively toward enslaved ants during the raiding season in summer
than in spring, when slave-makers never go on raids.</p>

<p>I must admit that arms race between animals is much more fascinating
than between humans!</p>
